Diagrams: Please find both diagrams in the repo.

For this repo, we've decided to use prettier. 
Installation instructions: 
https://prettier.io/docs/en/install.html

We're also going to be creating feature branches off of dev-main. 
The branch name will be as follows:
    [Issue number]-[Issue name]
    
Development Environment: In order to properly develop on a new workstation, the development environment should match up
                         with our previous developers. Run "npm install" to install the dependencies that are present. Do this
                         once in the frontend folder, and then again in the backend folder, as they have separate package.json files.
                         After installing the dependencies, you can run the backend by entering "npm run dev" while in the backend folder. 
                         To run the frontend, enter "npm start" while in the frontend folder.

For example, if the issue name is `Update Readme` and the issue number is 1. The branch name will be `1-Update Readme`.
