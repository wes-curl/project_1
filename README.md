For this repo, we've decided to use prettier. 
Installation instructions: 
https://prettier.io/docs/en/install.html

We're also going to be creating feature branches off of dev-main. 
The branch name will be as follows:
    [Issue number]-[Issue name]

For example, if the issue name is `Update Readme` and the issue number is 1. The branch name will be `1-Update Readme`.
